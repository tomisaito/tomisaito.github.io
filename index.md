Aspiring AI Researcher | Deep Learning Enthusiast

## About Me
I am studying to become an AI researcher.
My learning focuses on deep learning with PyTorch, covering the fundamentals of computer vision, natural language processing, and generative AI.
In the long term, I aim to contribute to both AI research and real-world applications.

### Current Learning Stack
* Python, PyTorch
* Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
* Git, FastAPI, Docker (currently learning)

## Projects
### 1. cifar10-image-classifier
A production-oriented image classification API built with PyTorch and FastAPI.
The model predicts one of the 10 CIFAR-10 categories from an input image.

### 2. my_hand_classifier
A deep learning project that classifies three specific left-hand gestures.
This model was designed as a thought experiment, focusing on data integrity and domain-specific assumptions rather than dataset scale.
